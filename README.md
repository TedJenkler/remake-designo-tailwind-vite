## Overview

This project is a solution to the Designo agency website challenge on Frontend Mentor, aimed at improving coding skills by building realistic projects. The challenge involves creating a multipage website for Designo agency with specific requirements regarding layout responsiveness, interactive elements, and form validation.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

### What I learned

Through this project, I was able to strengthen my understanding of Tailwind CSS, which allowed me to leverage its utility classes effectively for styling. Additionally, I improved my ability to transition layouts from flexbox to CSS Grid, enhancing the responsiveness and flexibility of my designs across various screen sizes.

By leveraging the structure and design elements implemented here, I aim to create a comprehensive portfolio that effectively highlights my work and skills. This approach will not only streamline the process but also ensure consistency across my portfolio, enhancing its overall presentation and user experience.
